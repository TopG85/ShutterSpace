- **Connection Pooling** (CONN_MAX_AGE = 600) for performance optimization
- **Environment-based Configuration** using DATABASE_URL

**Development Environment:**
- **SQLite Database** for local development
- **In-memory SQLite** for testing environments

```python
# Production database configuration
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
DATABASES['default']['CONN_MAX_AGE'] = 600
DATABASES['default']['OPTIONS'] = {
    'sslmode': 'require',
    'connect_timeout': 10,
}
```

### Custom Model Implementation

ShutterSpace implements **5 sophisticated custom models** that exceed basic requirements:

#### **1. Profile Model - Extended User Profiles**
```python
class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField(blank=True)
    avatar = CloudinaryField('avatar', blank=True)
    hero_image = CloudinaryField('hero_image', blank=True)
    display_name = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
    website = models.URLField(blank=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
    instagram = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    show_email = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

#### **2. Photo Model - Core Photography Content**
```python
class Photo(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    image = CloudinaryField('image')
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    is_public = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

#### **3. Comment Model - User Interactions**
```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    photo = models.ForeignKey(Photo, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

#### **4. Like Model - Social Engagement with Constraints**
```python
class Like(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    photo = models.ForeignKey(Photo, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='likes')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('user', 'photo')  # Prevents duplicate likes
```

#### **5. Notification Model - Advanced Notification System**
```python
class Notification(models.Model):
    recipient = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='notifications')
    sender = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='sent_notifications')
    notification_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=NOTIFICATION_TYPES)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    message = models.TextField()
    photo = models.ForeignKey(Photo, null=True, blank=True)
    is_read = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['recipient', 'is_read']),
            models.Index(fields=['created_at']),
        ]
```

### Database Relationships & Constraints

**Relationship Types Implemented:**
- **OneToOneField**: Profile ↔ User (automatic profile creation)
- **ForeignKey**: Photo → User, Comment → Photo/User, Notification → User/Photo
- **ManyToMany (through Like)**: User ↔ Photo with timestamp tracking
- **Related Names**: Optimised reverse relationship queries

**Database Constraints:**
- **Unique Together**: Prevents duplicate likes (user, photo)
- **Database Indexes**: Performance optimisation for notifications
- **CASCADE Deletion**: Proper cleanup when users/photos are deleted
- **Field Validation**: CharField limits, URLField validation, Boolean defaults

### Django ORM Usage - Efficient & Secure Operations

**Query Optimisation Examples:**
```python
# Efficient filtering with ordering and limits
photos = Photo.objects.filter(is_public=True).order_by('-created_at')[:6]

# Safe object retrieval with 404 handling
photo = get_object_or_404(Photo, owner=request.user)

# Efficient get-or-create operations
profile, created = Profile.objects.get_or_create(user=request.user)

# Related object queries with proper relationships
photos = Photo.objects.filter(owner=user).order_by('-created_at')
comments = Comment.objects.filter(photo=photo).select_related('author')
```

**Security Features:**
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Exclusive use of Django ORM
- **Parameterised Queries**: All database operations use Django's built-in protection
- **Proper Error Handling**: get_object_or_404 for safe object retrieval
- **Relationship Security**: Owner-based filtering for authorisation

## AI-Assisted Debugging & Problem Resolution

### Critical Debugging Interventions

Throughout the development process, AI tools proved invaluable for identifying and resolving complex technical issues that could have significantly delayed project completion.

**1. Django Template Syntax Error Resolution**
- **Issue**: Server Error 500 caused by complex parentheses in Django template conditionals
- **Error**: `Could not parse the remainder: '(comment.author' from '(comment.author'`
- **AI Intervention**: Immediately identified that Django template language doesn't support complex parentheses syntax in `{% if %}` statements
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI suggested restructuring conditional logic using nested `{% if %}` statements instead of parentheses
- **Outcome**: Critical server error resolved within minutes rather than hours of manual debugging

**2. Notification URL Resolution Bug**
- **Issue**: Notification links generating "Not found" errors when clicked
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded URLs not matching Django URL patterns with `/portfolio/` prefix
- **AI Intervention**: Analyzed URL routing structure and identified the mismatch between notification model URL generation and Django's URL resolver
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI recommended replacing hardcoded f-strings with Django's `reverse()` function for proper URL resolution
- **Outcome**: Fixed notification system functionality with proper URL generation across all notification types

**3. Comment Permission Logic Debugging**
- **Issue**: Users unable to see edit/delete buttons on their own comments due to operator precedence
- **Root Cause**: Template conditional `user.is_authenticated and comment.author == user or user == photo.owner` evaluated incorrectly
- **AI Intervention**: Identified operator precedence issue and explained how the condition was being parsed
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI suggested adding parentheses and restructuring the conditional logic for proper evaluation
- **Outcome**: Restored proper comment management functionality for all users

**4. Form Validation Edge Cases**
- **Issue**: Form validation not catching all invalid inputs and potential security vulnerabilities
