I've used Adobe colour wheel I took a screenshot of 
my webpage and used the colours from that to come up with a colour palette.


I took a screenshot of my website and you can upload to Adobe colour a choose the colour from within your site. You
can choose colour harmony, from Analogous, complementray and many more.
