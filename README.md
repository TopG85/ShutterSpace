# Front-End Design

I used Instagram, 500px and my old photography website as inspration for my photography portfolio website.

https://instagram.com/

https://500px.com/

I've used Adobe colour wheel to create my colour palette.
![adobe](<docs/readme_images/Screenshot 2025-09-26 at 14.08.03 (3)-1.png>)
I took a screenshot of my website and you can upload to Adobe colour a choose the colour from within your site. You
can choose colour harmony, from Analogous, complementray and many more.
![website](<docs/readme_images/Screenshot 2025-09-26 at 14.28.44 (3).png>)
my webpage and used the colours from that to come up with a colour palette.
Colour palette this was my initial colours, which did change slightly as did
have contrast issues. I also started with light theme and change that to dark

# Colour palette

# Final colour palette

![frontend](docs/readme_images/front-end-colourpalette-final.jpeg)

One fo the main reasons for changing the colours when a photograph is
in a frame you don't want the colours to detract from the photography the the users eyes to
to draw to the image and so the image stands out, it's why photography frame in a gallery are black and white.
It also improve the contrast the red colour did cause some problems.

## Wireframes

Same Idea with colour not detracting from the photographs I wanted the images to be in digital frame and the ShutterSpace is the gallery for photographers and retouchers can showcase there work!

    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField(blank=True)
    avatar = CloudinaryField('avatar', blank=True)
    hero_image = CloudinaryField('hero_image', blank=True)
    display_name = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
    website = models.URLField(blank=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
    instagram = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    show_email = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

#### **2. Photo Model - Core Photography Content**

```python
class Photo(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    image = CloudinaryField('image')
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    is_public = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

#### **3. Comment Model - User Interactions**

```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    photo = models.ForeignKey(Photo, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

#### **4. Like Model - Social Engagement with Constraints**

```python
class Like(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    photo = models.ForeignKey(Photo, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='likes')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('user', 'photo')  # Prevents duplicate likes
```

#### **5. Notification Model - Advanced Notification System**

```python
class Notification(models.Model):
    recipient = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='notifications')
    sender = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='sent_notifications')
    notification_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=NOTIFICATION_TYPES)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    message = models.TextField()
    photo = models.ForeignKey(Photo, null=True, blank=True)
    is_read = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['recipient', 'is_read']),
            models.Index(fields=['created_at']),
        ]
```

### Database Relationships & Constraints

**Relationship Types Implemented:**

- **OneToOneField**: Profile ↔ User (automatic profile creation)
- **ForeignKey**: Photo → User, Comment → Photo/User, Notification → User/Photo
- **ManyToMany (through Like)**: User ↔ Photo with timestamp tracking
- **Related Names**: Optimised reverse relationship queries

**Database Constraints:**

- **Unique Together**: Prevents duplicate likes (user, photo)
- **Database Indexes**: Performance optimisation for notifications
- **CASCADE Deletion**: Proper cleanup when users/photos are deleted
- **Field Validation**: CharField limits, URLField validation, Boolean defaults

### Django ORM Usage - Efficient & Secure Operations

**Query Optimisation Examples:**

```python
# Efficient filtering with ordering and limits
photos = Photo.objects.filter(is_public=True).order_by('-created_at')[:6]

# Safe object retrieval with 404 handling
photo = get_object_or_404(Photo, owner=request.user)

# Efficient get-or-create operations
profile, created = Profile.objects.get_or_create(user=request.user)

# Related object queries with proper relationships
photos = Photo.objects.filter(owner=user).order_by('-created_at')
comments = Comment.objects.filter(photo=photo).select_related('author')
```

**Security Features:**

## AI-Assisted Debugging & Problem Resolution

### Critical Debugging Interventions

Throughout the development process, AI tools proved invaluable for identifying and resolving complex technical issues that could have significantly delayed project completion.

**1. Django Template Syntax Error Resolution**

- **Issue**: Server Error 500 caused by complex parentheses in Django template conditionals
- **Error**: `Could not parse the remainder: '(comment.author' from '(comment.author'`
- **AI Intervention**: Immediately identified that Django template language doesn't support complex parentheses syntax in `{% if %}` statements
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI suggested restructuring conditional logic using nested `{% if %}` statements instead of parentheses
- **Outcome**: Critical server error resolved within minutes rather than hours of manual debugging

**2. Notification URL Resolution Bug**

- **Issue**: Notification links generating "Not found" errors when clicked
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded URLs not matching Django URL patterns with `/portfolio/` prefix
- **AI Intervention**: Analyzed URL routing structure and identified the mismatch between notification model URL generation and Django's URL resolver
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI recommended replacing hardcoded f-strings with Django's `reverse()` function for proper URL resolution
- **Outcome**: Fixed notification system functionality with proper URL generation across all notification types

**3. Comment Permission Logic Debugging**

- **Issue**: Users unable to see edit/delete buttons on their own comments due to operator precedence
- **Root Cause**: Template conditional `user.is_authenticated and comment.author == user or user == photo.owner` evaluated incorrectly
- **AI Intervention**: Identified operator precedence issue and explained how the condition was being parsed
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI suggested adding parentheses and restructuring the conditional logic for proper evaluation
- **Outcome**: Restored proper comment management functionality for all users

**4. Form Validation Edge Cases**

- **Issue**: Form validation not catching all invalid inputs and potential security vulnerabilities
- **AI Intervention**: Identified missing validation patterns and suggested comprehensive clean methods
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI generated additional validation logic for character limits, URL validation, and XSS prevention
- **Outcome**: Enhanced form security and user experience with comprehensive validation coverage

**5. Database Migration Conflicts**

- **Issue**: Complex model relationship changes causing migration conflicts
- **AI Intervention**: Analysed migration dependencies and suggested optimal migration strategy
- **Resolution Strategy**: AI recommended specific migration commands and field relationship adjustments
- **Outcome**: Smooth database schema evolution without data loss

### Debugging Methodology with AI

**Systematic Error Analysis**: AI helped establish a consistent approach to debugging:

1. **Error Identification**: AI quickly parsed error messages and identified root causes
2. **Context Analysis**: AI analysed surrounding code to understand the broader impact
3. **Solution Strategy**: AI suggested multiple resolution approaches with trade-offs
4. **Implementation Guidance**: AI provided step-by-step implementation instructions
5. **Validation Support**: AI helped create test cases to ensure fixes were complete

**Learning Through Debugging**: Each debugging session became a learning opportunity:
